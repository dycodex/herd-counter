# herd-counter
This is just for proof of concept to count nearby BLE-wearable devices. Currently, most of configuration can be changed in `global.h` file.

# Original Work
Almost all the code in this repo is currently based on the awesome work of [**ESP32-Paxcounter**](https://github.com/cyberman54/ESP32-Paxcounter) project by [@cyberman54](https://github.com/cyberman54). 
The original code is sophisticated and complete for many use cases and functionalities. I just changed it to focus more on BLE-based counting, not so much on WiFi. Also I don't need LoRa connectivity for now.
